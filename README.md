# decrypt-xyz3w
Decrypts newer *.3W format generated by XYZPrinting XYZware into zipped *.gcode (for daVinci 3D printer).

Past release of XYZware used to generate *.3W files which are actually just a base64 encoded gcode.
However, recent XYZware hardened the format by AES-encrypting ZIPped gcode, instead of just base64 encoding.

Decryption method was posted to Voltivo site, and this simply makes it into a command.

## Usage

    $ javac DecryptXYZ3W.java
    $ java DecryptXYZ3W foo.3w foo.zip
    $ unzip foo.zip
  
## NOTE
I have tested the code to work with a new 3W format generated by XYZware 1.1.29.4.
